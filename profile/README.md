Nuraan AI develops advanced analytical systems to inform strategic development. Our work focuses on transforming complex temporo-spatial data into clear, actionable intelligence.

Our principal undertaking, Project Nuraan, applies these systems to large-scale anonymised telecom and geospatial datasets. The objective is to identify optimal locations for essential infrastructure and services, thereby supporting equitable community development.

## Purpose

We aim to provide decision-makers in government, finance, and social enterprise with precise, data-derived insights. This enables the effective allocation of resources for new financial access points, healthcare facilities, and educational centres. Our initial focus is Bangladesh, with a view to broader applications.
